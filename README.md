## Description
This repository delves into the study "Less Motorcycles, More Safety? The Effectiveness of Mobility Restrictions on Crime" focusing on Valledupar, Colombia. Since 2011, local governments have implemented motorcycle mobility restrictions, including the prohibition of passenger carrying, to curb crime rates. This investigation questions the effectiveness of such mobility restrictions in reducing crime rates, exploring the hypothesis that these measures do not significantly impact crime reduction. The study leverages data from the National Police's criminal statistics database (SIEDCO) and employs a Difference-in-Differences methodology to analyze crime trends before and after the implementation of restrictions in 2014.

### Document Structure
The study is structured to first provide a theoretical framework, drawing on Becker (1968) and Ehrlich (1973) to understand criminal decision-making processes. It then describes the data sourced from SIEDCO, covering crime reports from 2012 to 2016 in Valledupar. The methodology section explains the Difference-in-Differences approach, alongside a dynamic event study model to assess the policy's temporal effects on crime rates. The results section presents findings on the non-significant impact of mobility restrictions on overall crime rates, despite initial hypotheses.

### Methodology
The analysis employs a standard Difference-in-Differences model, complemented by Time-Weighted Fixed Effects (TWFE) and a dynamic event study framework. This multifaceted approach allows for a nuanced understanding of the policy's effect over time and across different types of crime, challenging the assumption that restricting motorcycle mobility effectively reduces criminal activities.

## Data
Data originates from the SIEDCO database, focusing on crime reports in Valledupar between 2012 and 2016. The analysis considers a variety of crimes, including theft and homicide, with a particular emphasis on those committed using motorcycles.

## Conclusion
The study concludes that mobility restrictions on motorcycles in Valledupar do not lead to a significant reduction in crime rates. It suggests that policymakers should consider more comprehensive strategies that address the root causes of crime rather than implementing superficial mobility restrictions.
